            royalty-free license to aggregate or compile Customer Data with
            customer data of other users of Pavshop so long as such
            aggregation or compilation omits any data that would enable the
            identification of you (“Aggregated Data”). Xmartlabs shall have a
            worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to use, modify,
            distribute and create derivative works based on such Aggregated

            compilations of the Aggregated Data, including all reports,
            statistics or analyses created or derived therefrom.
          </p>
          <p>
            You understand that projects in Pavshop will display Customer
            Data to you and any collaborators that you designate for that
            project. You are solely responsible for any collaborators and

          <p>
            You are solely responsible for configuring Pavshop to allow
            appropriate access to your Customer Data. Xmartlabs is not
            responsible if you fail to configure, or misconfigure, your project
            and inadvertently allow unauthorized parties to view any Customer
            Data.

            verify the accuracy or ownership of the information contained in/on
            any Third Party Site or any products or services advertised on Third
            Party Sites. If you decide to leave the Site and navigate to Third
            Party Sites, or install any software or download content from any
            such Third Party Sites, you do so at your own risk. Once you access
            a Third Party Site through a link on our Site, you may be subject to

            of conflict of laws, and the parties consent to the jurisdiction of

          <p>
            These Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and

          </p>
          <p>
            If any part of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that
            portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable
            law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of
            the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force
            and effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            The failure of Xmartlabs to exercise or enforce any right or
            provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right
            or provision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Xmartlabs shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of
